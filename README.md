# Hi, there👋
## My name is Igor Khaustov, and I'm an indie game developer from Russia. Currently, I'm studying Computer Science at Voronezh State University and coworking at two of my main projects. 
⚡<b>NinjaGod</b>: This game is about miracle powers and elemental control. It's supposed to be a 3D game where you can make whatever you want with your enemies and make epic frag movies. It's inspired by animes like Naruto and Demon Slayer. <br>
⚡<b>SamuraiDefense2D</b>: This game is about samurai that defends his sensei. It's supposed to be a 2D timekiller where you use simple mechanics: some enemies can defend your attacks from above and others from the bottom. Also, you'll be able to use some cool abilities and skills to slayer your enemies a bit faster. <br>
